    <h2>Role Overview</h2>
    <p>At American Ordnance, we’re delivering the talent foundation that powers the front lines of national security. As Director of Human Resources, you’ll lead the HR function for two large, complex unionized manufacturing facilities supporting over 1,400 employees across Iowa and Tennessee. This is a critical executive-level role with a direct line to enterprise leadership and a mandate to shape the company’s people strategy from the ground up.</p>
    <p>From contract negotiations to AI-enabled talent transformation, you’ll lead HR operations across labor relations, performance management, talent acquisition, and workforce development. You’ll ensure compliance with government and defense regulations while building a progressive, high-impact HR function that supports organizational growth, safety, and purpose.</p>
