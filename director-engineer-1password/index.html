    <h1>Director of Engineering — Platform, Developer Tools & Enterprise Growth</h1>
    <p><strong>Remote (U.S. & Canada) | Full-Time | 1Password</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Role Overview</h2>
      <p>At 1Password, we’re building the secure access foundation for the AI-powered, multi-device workplace. As Director of Engineering, you’ll lead one of the most strategically important divisions in our company — a cross-functional organization of over 30 engineers and managers responsible for the infrastructure that powers secure identity, access, and developer experiences across our enterprise platform.</p>
      <p>This division owns high-leverage systems used by tens of thousands of teams globally, including APIs, SDKs, developer tooling, authentication frameworks, and core extensibility services. You’ll lead delivery, scale the organization, and influence company-wide product and technical strategy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Scope and Challenge</h2>
      <p><strong>Build and Scale a High-Performance Engineering Organization:</strong> Grow and evolve a multi-team engineering division with 30+ people, ensuring clear team structure, strong management layers, and consistent delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Deliver a Complex, Secure, and Extensible Platform at Scale:</strong> Lead the design and delivery of the systems that power enterprise and developer use cases—SSO, provisioning, APIs, SDKs—with reliability and extensibility.</p>
      <p><strong>Drive Strategic Technical Roadmaps That Shape the Business:</strong> Partner with executive leaders across product, design, and GTM to define and deliver platform strategy that supports adoption, integrations, and growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Employee Value Proposition (EVP)</h2>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Lead the evolution of a secure platform that empowers businesses to grow without compromising trust or flexibility.</p>
      <p><strong>Growth:</strong> Operate with full ownership and influence in one of the company’s most critical growth domains, directly tied to product expansion and enterprise success.</p>
      <p><strong>Motivators:</strong> This is a rare opportunity to lead at scale, solve complex technical and organizational challenges, and collaborate with a high-trust, high-performance team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Makes This a Win-Win Career Move</h2>
      <p>This is not just a job opening. It’s a strategic leadership opportunity to scale a platform that already supports tens of thousands of global teams — and make it faster, more secure, and more flexible for the next ten thousand.</p>
      <p>If you’re ready for a move that offers more scale, more impact, and more visibility than your current role, this could be it. We follow the <strong>Win-Win Hiring™</strong> model: no offers unless it’s the right career move for you <em>and</em> a strategic gain for us.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How to Explore the Career Potential of This Role</h2>
      <p>If this role looks like it could represent a strong next step in your career — one that offers more scope, more complexity, and greater long-term impact — we’d love to begin a brief, exploratory conversation.</p>
      <p><strong>Don’t send a resume.</strong> Instead, please share:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A link to your <strong>LinkedIn profile</strong>, and</li>
        <li>A short <strong>write-up</strong> (2–3 paragraphs) or <strong>brief video</strong> describing a <strong>major accomplishment</strong> that’s comparable in scope or challenge to the work described above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tell us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What was the business or technical challenge?</li>
        <li>What was your specific role?</li>
        <li>What outcome did your leadership drive?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ll personally review each submission and follow up with those that align most closely to the opportunity to set up a brief exploratory call — no pressure, no commitment.</p>
